# Technical Architecture

- Game is drawn using the LVGL library
- Game is a state machine with the following states:
  - Start
  - Game
  - Game Over
  
# Data models:
  - Snake length and position
  - Food position
  - Score
  
# UI/UX:
  - Score display in the top-left corner
  - Game over screen with restart button
  - Start screen with start button
  
# Logical Dependency Chain
- Which features need to be built first (foundation)
- Getting as quickly as possible to something usable/visible front end that works
- Properly pacing and scoping each feature so it is atomic but can also be built upon and improved as development approaches]

# Appendix
- This is existing firmware with few apps built-in, you will analyze how are they built and keep the new app style as close as possible
