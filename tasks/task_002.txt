# Task ID: 2
# Title: Create Basic Snake Game App Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the basic structure for the Snake game app following the patterns used in existing InfiniTime apps.
# Details:
1. Create a new directory for the Snake game app in the appropriate location
2. Implement the basic app class structure with necessary includes
3. Set up the state machine framework with Start, Game, and Game Over states
4. Register the app with the system following existing patterns
5. Implement empty handlers for each state
6. Add app icon and entry in the app launcher

Example class structure:
```cpp
class SnakeGameApp : public App {
public:
  enum class States { Start, Game, GameOver };
  
  SnakeGameApp();
  ~SnakeGameApp() override;
  
  void OnStart();
  void OnGame();
  void OnGameOver();
  
  void SwitchState(States newState);
  
private:
  States currentState = States::Start;
  // Other members will be added later
};
```

# Test Strategy:
Compile the basic app structure and verify it can be launched from the app menu without crashing. Test state transitions with mock implementations.
