# Task ID: 10
# Title: Integrate and Test Complete Game
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate all components and perform comprehensive testing of the complete Snake game.
# Details:
1. Ensure all components work together seamlessly
2. Test the complete game flow from start to game over
3. Verify that the snake moves correctly, grows when eating food, and wraps around screen borders
4. Check that the score updates correctly
5. Verify that touch input controls work as expected
6. Test state transitions between Start, Game, and Game Over screens
7. Optimize performance if needed
8. Ensure the app follows the style and patterns of existing InfiniTime apps

Final integration steps:
```cpp
// Register the app with the system
AppDescriptor snakeAppDescriptor = {
  .name = "Snake",
  .icon = &snake_icon,
  .create = []() -> App* { return new SnakeGameApp(); }
};

// In the app initialization
void SnakeGameApp::Init() {
  // Initialize screen dimensions
  screenWidth = LV_HOR_RES;
  screenHeight = LV_VER_RES;
  
  // Set initial state
  SwitchState(States::Start);
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Perform end-to-end testing of the complete game by playing through multiple game sessions and verifying: proper game initialization, correct game mechanics, accurate scoring, responsive controls, proper state transitions, and adherence to InfiniTime app design patterns. Test on actual PineTime hardware to ensure performance and touch responsiveness meet expectations.
