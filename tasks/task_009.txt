# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Touch Input Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the touch input handling to control the snake's direction.
# Details:
1. Implement logic to detect touch events on the left and right halves of the screen
2. Add direction change logic based on touch position
3. Ensure the snake cannot immediately reverse direction (e.g., from right to left)

Example implementation:
```cpp
enum class Direction { Up, Right, Down, Left };

void SnakeGameApp::TurnSnakeLeft() {
  switch (currentDirection) {
    case Direction::Up:
      currentDirection = Direction::Left;
      break;
    case Direction::Right:
      currentDirection = Direction::Up;
      break;
    case Direction::Down:
      currentDirection = Direction::Right;
      break;
    case Direction::Left:
      currentDirection = Direction::Down;
      break;
  }
}

void SnakeGameApp::TurnSnakeRight() {
  switch (currentDirection) {
    case Direction::Up:
      currentDirection = Direction::Right;
      break;
    case Direction::Right:
      currentDirection = Direction::Down;
      break;
    case Direction::Down:
      currentDirection = Direction::Left;
      break;
    case Direction::Left:
      currentDirection = Direction::Up;
      break;
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Test touch input handling by simulating touch events on different parts of the screen and verifying: correct direction changes based on touch position, prevention of immediate direction reversal, and proper integration with the game logic.
